# CodeGrandmaster
CodeGrandmaster is a hierarchical multi-agent monster that attacks Codeforces problems like a chess engine with a superiority complex. Interns propose, seniors argue, the CEO judges, and the sandbox decides who’s delusional. ELO rises, sessions reset, hallucinations get fired. Strategy over vibes. Only clean wins survive.
